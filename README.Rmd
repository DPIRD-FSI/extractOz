Extract the GRDC agroecological zone, major soil order and weather data from your GPS sampling points.
Datasets for the GRDC agroecological zones and functions that automatically download modified data from the Digital Atlas of Australian Soils are included in this package for ease of use.
You may also use your own geospatial vector format file to extract similar information using the generic function, `extract_area()`.

## Quick start

You can install {extractOz} like so.

```{r setup, eval=FALSE}
if (!require("remotes")) {
  install.packages("remotes")
}

remotes::install_github("DPIRD-FSI/extractOz", build_vignettes = TRUE)
```

Load the packages necessary to execute the examples that follow.

```{r load-libs}
library(extractOz)
library(dplyr)
```

## Create locations in WA and NSW

```{r create-locs}
locs <- list(
  "Merredin" = c(x = 118.28, y = -31.48),
  "Corrigin" = c(x = 117.87, y = -32.33),
  "Tamworth" = c(x = 150.84, y = -31.07)
)
```

## Extract the GRDC AgroEcological Zones

See `?extract_ae_zone()` for more help on how to use this function.

```{r az-zone}
z <- extract_ae_zone(x = locs)
```

## Extract the soil order

See `?extract_soil_order()` for more help on how to use this function.

```{r soil-order}
s <- extract_daas_soil_order(x = locs)
```

## Get Weather Data for these Locations in 2020

Using the previously used list of GPS points, fetch weather data from SILO for 2020.
This is just a non-working example, replace `your_api_key` with your email address below.
See `?extract_patched_point()` for more help on how to use this function.

### A Note on API Keys

The examples in this README assume that you have stored your API key in your .Renviron file.
See [Chapter 8](https://rstats.wtf/r-startup.html#renviron) in "What They Forgot to Teach You About R" by Bryan _et al._ for more on storing details in your .Renviron if you are unfamiliar.

```{r ppd}
three_sites <-
  extract_patched_point(
    x = locs,
    start_date = "20200101",
    end_date = "20201231",
    api_key = Sys.getenv("SILO_API_KEY")
  )
```

## Join the Weather Data with AE Zone, Soil Order and Site Information

Now using `dplyr::left_join()`, create a single `data.frame()` of the location, GPS coordinates, agroecological zone and weather data.

```{r join-all}
left_join(z, three_sites, by = c("location" = "location")) %>% 
  left_join(s)
```
